🔧 Tried building a small ML model that predicts the vibe of your sentence — and replies with an emoji.
Basically, you talk, it reacts… like a slightly confused but well-meaning bestie 😅

Used TF-IDF and Logistic Regression with a custom dataset I cooked up — still a work in progress da, it’s learning slowly (just like us on Mondays).

Type “I’m tired” and it might get it right. Type “I love my dog” and sometimes it sends a party invite 🥲
Still, it was a fun way to brush up on text vectorization and classification.
